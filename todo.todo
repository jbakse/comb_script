Design Decisions
-	size never considers children, only parent context
-	inspired by openscad, -illustrator, html/css, flash symbols

QUESTIONS
-	sibling relative positioning: what are some options

First Priority

----	Github it


Shapes
+-	rectangle
+-	ellipse
-	vertical_line
-	horizontal_line
-	regular polygon (hexagon, ...)
-	polygon as array of points
--	import svg

Transform
----	translate
+---	rotate
---	scale
---	mirror

Booleans
+-	union
+-	difference
+-	intersection
-	sibling union?
-	sibling difference?
-	sibling interseciton?

Positioning
--	min/max width/height: 


Region (basic unit of position & transforming)

Special Regions
-	region_grid
	- every child every squre, or once child per square, repeating
-	auto arrange: takes children and packs them into space

Manipulation
-	offset paths: move points along normals.
-	randomize


Language Features
--	units and percenteges: margin_left: 10cm, margin_right: 20%


-	remove overlapping line segments: good for lasercut prep





Features
-	control of grouping in output
-	draw names/labels on output?
-	Greg Font (line / not shape) Sutton

-	Mathmatic Expressions
	-	With variables from context

- 	hull
-	minkowski

-	reconsider yaml format
-	include other yaml (user libraries, etc)
-	look into custom yaml handlers



Sketching:
-	Openscad is awesome
-	YAML is suprisingly powerful and awesome
-	Illustrator is frustrating


change context to be current matrix relative always. drop the positoin (thats part of translate)
	get rid of registration
