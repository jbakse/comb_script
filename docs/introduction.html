			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Comb Script is a language for describing technical vector drawings and a tool that exports these drawings as SVG files. 
			<p>Comb Script was inspired by OpenSCAD, CSS, and HTML</p>

				Comb Script files describe parametric drawings declaritively, focusing on the positional relationships of shapes in the design.

				Comb Script was originally inspried by OpenSCAD.

			<h1>Document Structure</h1>
				Comb Script documents are written in YAML [link], a common and human-readable data-file format. Comb Script recognizes predefined keywords to describe regions, shapes, and their properties.

			<h2>Regions</h2>
				The core element of a Comb Script document is a Region. A Region defines a positional boundary in the document and can contain child Regions. Plain Regions are primarily organizational and do not correspond to specific output shapes. Specialized Region Types like Rectangles and Ellipses generate output.

			<h2>Properties</h2>
				Region properties describe specific aspects of Regions, such as `width` and `height`. Properties are described as a key-value map under the heading `properties:`.
<pre>
#very_simple.yaml
#a very simple comb-script
children:
    - region:
        properties:
            width: 200
            height: 150
</pre>


			<h2>Nesting and Children</h2>
				Nesting Regions is a key structural element of Comb Script documents. Regions can contain zero or more child regions. Nested regions are positioned and sized relative to the bounds of their parent.
				You can also nest regions just to make your documents easier to understand. A region's children are defined in an array under the heading `children:`.
<pre>
#nesting_simple.yaml
children:
    #this region is a child of the 'document'
    - region:
        properties:
            width: 300
            height: 300
        #and also has a child of it's own
        children:
            #children are defined in an array
            - region:
                properties:
                    name: only_child
                    height: 100
                    width: 100
                    margin_left: 30
</pre>

			<h2>YAML</h2>
				Comb Script documents are written in YAML.

		<section id="regions">
			<h1>Regions</h1>
			<h2>Bounds</h2>
				Every region has a rectangular bounds. These boundaries can specified directly with the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and `right` properties. These properties use the coordinate system set by the region's parent. A region's bounds can also be specified relative to the parent's bounds using `margin-top`, `margin-left`, `margin-bottom`, and `margin-right` properties. You can specify the dimensions of the bounds with the `width` and `height` properties. You can mix these properties any way you wish, as long as they don't conflict. 
<pre>
#bounds_simple.yaml
children:
    - region:
        #this region is 200x200 units
        properties:
            top: -100
            left: -100
            bottom: 100
            right: 100
</pre>
			<h2>Registration</h2>
				Regions can optionally redefine the zero point of the coordinate system with the `registration` property. By default `registration` is set to `parent` which will preserve the location of the origin set by the region's parent. Other values, such as 'top_left' and 'center' move the origin relative to the Region's bounds.


			<h2>Transformations</h2>
				You can specify transformations to apply to a region's shape and it's children with the `rotation`, `scale_x`, and `scale_y` properties.

	 	<section id="shapes">
	 		<h1>Shapes</h1>
	 			The basic Region type is primarily organizational and will not generate a vector shape in the exported SVG. To create a exported shape, use specialized Region-types such as Rectangles and Ellipses.


	 		<h2>Boolean Operations</h2>
	 			Complex Shapes can be created by combining basic shapes using boolean operations. Use the `boolean` property combine a region's shape witto `add`, `subtract`, or `intersect`.
