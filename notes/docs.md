# Region properties like width, height, left, and top require
# `dimension` values that contain both a number and a unit.
# Dimensions can be given in standard units like meters,
# centimeters, inches, feet, and pixels. Standard abbreviations
# are supported as well.

# It is a general good practice to use the unit that most naturally
# expresses your dimension, rather than converting manually. For
# example, `.5in` rather than `12.7mm`
